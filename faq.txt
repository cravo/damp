The DAMP FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
=========================================

This should hopefully save me having to answer the
same questions over and over again by email...


Q: Will you add support for input device "blah" ?
Q: Will you add support for IRMan?
Q: Will you add support for infra-red remotes?
A: No, that's what the input driver system is for.  I am
   quite happy to add any features to the input driver
   system that would help YOU to write a driver - but I
   don't have the time or knowledge to write a driver
   for a piece of hardware I don't even own...

Q: Can you recommend an LCD display for use with DAMP ?
A: No - I don't use an LCD with DAMP.  The best place to
   ask questions about LCDs is on the DAMP mailing list
   (details of how to subscribe are on the DAMP web site).
   There are plenty of people there who should be able to
   help.

Q: Why don't you release the DAMP source code?
A: I will - but not yet.  So many times I've looked at an
   open source project and the source is so difficult to
   understand and extend (mostly due to lack of comments
   and relevant documentation) that it seems pointless that
   the source was ever released.  I want to put together
   a nice package that should make it fairly easy for people
   to alter DAMP to suit their needs (assuming they know C
   of course).

Q: The sound quality is poor - how can I make it sound better?
A: That's what the "Getting the best sound quality" section of
   the DAMP readme.txt is for.

Q: I have a 486. Will DAMP run on my system?
Q: When I run DAMP on my 486 the sound stutters. Why?
A: DAMP will run on a 486.  What type of MP3 files you can play
   will depend on the MHz speed of your processor, but don't
   expect to play stereo 128Kbps MP3 files on a 486-33MHz.  You
   should be able to play lower bit-rate MP3 files, and you could
   try mono MP3 files as well.  Make sure you use the -q 0 option,
   and the -noscope option.  Don't even think about trying the
   visualisation mode as that WILL cause stuttering on such a slow
   machine.  You should also set the "quality" setting in the "[sound]"
   section of DAMP.ini (at the bottom of the ini file) to 0.  Also,
   try adjusting the "sound_freq" setting in the same section to a lower
   frequency and see if that helps.

Q: I've found this bug that does this: "blah blah blah". Can
   you fix it ?
A: You forgot to tell me what version of DAMP you're using, and
   all you're going to get back is an email asking what version
   of DAMP you are using.  READ THE README.TXT. It clearly states
   in at least 2 places that you should tell me what version of
   DAMP you're using when reporting a bug.  Come on - please
   help save my time and yours - read the instructions.

Q: Why don't you make DAMP load the MP3 into memory first ?
A: Because that feature isn't supported in the MP3 playback library
   I use.  If you want to hack that library about and add that
   feature, go ahead - I'll then support that feature in DAMP.

Q: Why don't you make DAMP automatically scan a drive for MP3s ?
A: 1. Because that sort of feature belongs in a front-end, not in
      DAMP itself.  There is a front-end for DAMP available
      at http://pluto.spaceports.com/~mpdj/
   2. Because you can achieve this feature very easily. Let's assume
      you want to scan C: for all MP3 files and play them in DAMP:

      a) From DOS, or an MS-DOS prompt in Windows, change to the
         directory where DAMP is installed and type:

            edit dampall.bat

         and hit ENTER.
      b) You should now have a blank page infront of you. Type:

            dir /S/B c:\*.mp3 >playlist.m3u
            damp.exe playlist.m3u

         Then select "Save" from the file menu. Then select "Exit"
         from the file menu.
      c) Now whenever you want to play all the MP3's on C drive, just
         change to your DAMP directory and type@

            dampall
